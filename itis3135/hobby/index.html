            <p>
                I have played sports my entire life. I started playing volleyball when I was 
                about 9 years old, and it became my favorite sport. I continued to play volleyball
                through highschool, and I also tried out basketball and softball.

                and fitness a part of my weekly routine, as I know how important it is for my mental
                and physical health.

            <p>My weekly workout schedule is a lose guideline that describes what time I usually end up

            <p>
                My schedule usually revolves around when I can fit in 2 hours to go to the gym in between 
                my classes, hoemework, and my part-time job.

            <h2>Gym Location</h2>

            <p>I workout at my local gym to lift weights as well as run indoors. I 
                also enjoy running on campus occasionally when the weather permits.
            </p>

            <p>
                Jogging outside on a nice day is one of my favorite activties, and I always finish the run 
                in a good mood.

            <h2>Workout Routines</h2>
            
            <p>Typically, I  workout my back and biceps on Tuesdays and my chest  and triceps on Thursdays, and my 
                legs on Mondays and Fridays. I like to do at least 15 minutes of cardio after every workout.

            </figure>

            <p>
                I keep the longer cardio times to the days where I am only doing cardio, so I don't burn myself out of it.
                I try to stick to doing the stairmaster on days when I workout my legs, and running when I workout my upper body 
                . Above is an image of the longest distance I have ever gone without stopping. I know this isn't professional
                level by any means, but 4 miles is a very good distance for me.

            <h3>Prompt 1- Section separation and unique visibility: </h3>

            <p>I want to have my website have different sections, each with separate headings, 
                paragraphs and images, and those sections be hidden. I want a menu to appear on a 
                sidebar with buttons that show each section of the site, but only one section 
                should be visible at a time. How should I accomplish this?
            </p>

            <h3>Prompt 2- Moving the menu below the header using HTML: </h3>
            <p>my header has a main title that I want to show up at all times, and I want the menu 
                to appear below this.
            </p>

            <h3>Prompt 3- Making a table to describe my weekly workout schedule: </h3>
            <p>(pt.1) I want to make a table using html and css only. The table should have 7 columns and 2 rows
            </p>
            <p>(pt. 2) how do i make it so that the table itself shrinks as well as the font when the window gets
                 smaller. The table goes across the main border when the window is too small
