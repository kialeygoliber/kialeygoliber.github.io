            <h3>Bad Website: <a class="main-links" href="https://www.art.yale.edu" target="_blank">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
            <p>
                This is the main website for updates, events, news,and even the location to apply to the Yale School of Art. 
                They provide a description of the site as well as a disclaimer that the site is an experiment and that most students 
                have the ability to add/update information to the site.
                <br><br>CRAP Principles: <br>
                <ul class="evaluation_list">
                    <li class="crap_list c">  Every text has a background that allows for readability, but
                         the contrasting background really only affects in between the letters, and not the tops and bottoms of the 
                         text.</li>
                    <li class="crap_list r"> The background colors and styles vary greatly across the whole site, and the 
                        only form of color repetition is a bright green and yellow used in gradients and as some of the backgrounds. 
                        The links on the page also look different, some change color when hovered over and some don't.  </li>
                    <li class="crap_list a"> All of the text on the website is left justified, but the alignment of the contents of
                        the webpage are aligned to the left of the center, and they only take up half of the screen. It seems as though
                        the sheer yellow stripe in the background is meant to be like the center of the content, but the heading for the 
                        different sections do not align with this stripe. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="crap_list p"> The site does not have the same issues with proximity as it does with the overall 
                        visual appeal, all of the content for the webpage seems to be organized in the way it should be. However, the use of 
                        thin black bars as section dividers is a very interesting choice I suppose it gets the job done. 
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Good Website: <a class="main-links" href="https://drinkolipop.com/index" target="_blank">Olipop Prebiotic Soda</a></h3>
            <p>
                The Olipop website is the official website of the product by the name of Olipop which is a prebiotic soda that is 
                supposedly good for your gut biome and overall health. 
                <br><br>CRAP Principles: <br>
                <ul class="evaluation_list">
                    <li class="crap_list c">The use of contrast is present on this page in the color scheme chosen. The dark green text 
                        on the cream and white colored backgrounds contrast nicely and allow for easy readability
                    </li>
                    <li class="crap_list r"> The color scheme and font are consistent throughout the website. One detail that I liked that 
                        showcases the good repetition aspects is that they use the same font style on the cans of soda as they do for some
                        of the font on the website.
                    </li>
                    <li class="crap_list a">There is good usage of alignment, there is a clear divide in the center of the page to separate 
                        sections for images/videos, and this line showcases the symmetry of the page very well. The text that is center aligned is also
                    spaced out well.  </li>
                    <li class="crap_list p"> The home/index separates content using subtle lines created by the contrast in different backgrounds
                        and this makes the separation of different sections clear. the cream colored bar at the top also does a good job of separating
                        the essential tools for the site. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
