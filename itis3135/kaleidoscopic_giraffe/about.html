        <h2>Our Details</h2>
        <p> Kaleidoscopic Giraffe Ceramics is a handmade pottery store selling several types of stoneware ceramics. Our ceramics 
            are not only brightly colored (as per the Kaleidoscopic description in our title!), they are also built to last. 
            Each of our products is hand thrown on a pottery wheel by our founder Kialey Goliber, and they are designed to 
            withstand years of daily use. They are even dishwasher AND microwave safe! Purchase your new favorite brightly colored mug, 
            bowl, vase, or cup today through our website and help a young entrepreneur make her dream a reality!
