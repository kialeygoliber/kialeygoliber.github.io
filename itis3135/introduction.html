            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Personal background: </strong>I am from a small town about an hour away from Charlotte, and before that from an even smaller town even farther away from Charlotte. 
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Academic background: </strong>I graduated from an early college high school so I got a diploma as well as an associates in Arts from my local community college.</li>
                <li> <strong>Professional background:</strong> I have worked as a server at Outback Steakhouse part time since I graduated high school. </li>
                <li> <strong>Background in this subject: </strong> Back in high school I wanted to major in psychology, so I didn't have any computer science background prior to about 2 years ago when I started attending UNCC. I sometimes feel that I am a bit of a newbie in computer science as a whole because it seems like some of my classmates have been coding for many years already. I have no experience in web app development, but I am ready to learn!
